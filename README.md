## Databases:
- Overall:
	- If your data has relationships, relational
	- If the database is inconsistent fields that are unlikely to repeat, noSQL, like mongoDB
	- For edgepairs or to store network information, graph dbs, like neo4j
	- to store geo info: PostGIS enabled Postgres
 	- If your database is large and you would like to analyze by topic rather than by user, Columnar
